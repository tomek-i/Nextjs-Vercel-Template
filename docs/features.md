## CVA - A New Approach to Variants

While CSS-in-TS libraries such as [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) and [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) are great for building type-safe UI components, they might not be the perfect fit for everyone. You may prefer more control over your stylesheets, need to use a framework like Tailwind CSS, or simply enjoy writing your own CSS.

Creating variants using traditional CSS can be a tedious task, requiring you to manually match classes to props and add types. CVA is here to take that pain away, allowing you to focus on the enjoyable aspects of UI development. By providing an easy and type-safe way to create variants, CVA simplifies the process and helps you create powerful design systems without compromising on the flexibility and control of CSS.

## ü§ñ ChatGPT Code Review

We've integrated the innovative [ChatGPT Code Review](https://github.com/anc95/ChatGPT-CodeReview) for AI-powered, automated code reviews. This feature provides real-time feedback on your code, helping improve code quality and catch potential issues.

To use ChatGPT Code Review, add an `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with an appropriate key from the OpenAI platform. For setup details, refer to the [Using GitHub Actions](https://github.com/anc95/ChatGPT-CodeReview#using-github-actions) section in the documentation.

## üíª Environment Variables handling

[T3 Env](https://env.t3.gg/) is a library that provides environmental variables checking at build time, type validation and transforming. It ensures that your application is using the correct environment variables and their values are of the expected type. You‚Äôll never again struggle with runtime errors caused by incorrect environment variable usage.

Config file is located at `env.mjs`. Simply set your client and server variables and import `env` from any file in your project.

```ts
export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    // Server variables
    SECRET_KEY: z.string(),
  },
  client: {
    // Client variables
    API_URL: z.string().url(),
  },
  runtimeEnv: {
    // Assign runtime variables
    SECRET_KEY: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
    API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  },
})
```

If the required environment variables are not set, you'll get an error message:

```sh
  ‚ùå Invalid environment variables: { SECRET_KEY: [ 'Required' ] }
```
